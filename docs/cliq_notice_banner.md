## CLIQ NOTICE BANNER SPEC

This document defines the structure and behavior of the in-cliq notice system for Cliqstr. These banners appear at the top of each cliq's main page (`/cliqs/[id]`) and communicate timely information to members. Notices are automated (e.g., birthdays, safety alerts) or posted by cliq admins.

### üß† DATABASE MODEL: `CliqNotice`

```ts
model CliqNotice {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  cliqId      String
  type        String   // birthday, admin, red_alert_open, red_alert_resolved
  content     String   // message to display
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  expiresAt   DateTime?
  cliq        Cliq     @relation(fields: [cliqId], references: [id])
}
```

- `expiresAt` controls auto-dismissal for birthday/resolved alerts
- Admin notices may remain until manually removed

---

### üîê APA-SAFE ENFORCEMENT

- All notices are visible **only to authenticated users who are members of the cliq**
- No notice content is ever shared outside of cliq context
- `getCurrentUser()` is used to validate session before rendering notices
- Parents silently monitoring their child's cliqs will see the notices as well
