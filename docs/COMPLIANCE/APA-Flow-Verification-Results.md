# APA Flow Verification Results
*Verified on: July 25, 2025*

## Overview
This document summarizes the verification of the current implementation against the APA-Flow-Scenarios.md design document.

## 1. Adult Sign-Up Flow

**Design Requirements:**
- Sign-up collects: First Name, Last Name, Birthdate, Email
- Resend sends confirmation email
- User clicks confirmation link → `User.isVerified = true`
- Redirected to `/choose-plan`
- After plan selection → `/my-cliqs-dashboard`

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ Sign-up collects all required fields
- ✅ Sends verification email via Resend
- ✅ Redirects to `/verification-pending` page
- ❌ **ISSUE**: No `User.isVerified` field exists (uses `verificationToken = null` instead)
- ❌ **ISSUE**: Email verification sets `Account.isApproved = true` directly instead of just verifying email
- ✅ When signing in after verification, unapproved users redirect to `/choose-plan`
- ✅ After plan selection, redirects to `/my-cliqs-dashboard`

**Discrepancies:**
1. Missing `User.isVerified` field - system uses `verificationToken = null` to indicate verified
2. Email verification conflates verification with approval

## 2. Child Sign-Up Flow

**Design Requirements:**
- Child fills out: First name, Last name, Birthdate
- System detects age < 18 → role: child
- Prompts for parent email
- Sends email to parent
- Child sees `/awaiting-approval`
- Parent approval flow through `/parent-approval`
- Parent must set child credentials

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ All requirements fully implemented
- ✅ Age detection works correctly
- ✅ Parent email collection and notification
- ✅ Child sees appropriate waiting page
- ✅ Parent approval creates accounts and links
- ✅ Parent HQ includes credential setup UI

**Result:** ✅ Fully compliant

## 3. Adult-to-Child Invite Flow

**Design Requirements:**
- Radio select: Invite Adult or Invite Child
- For child invites: collect child name & parent email
- Send email to parent (not child)
- Store invite with special fields

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ Radio button selection implemented
- ✅ Collects required fields for child invites
- ✅ Sends email to parent/guardian
- ✅ Stores invite with `inviteType`, `friendFirstName`, `trustedAdultContact`

**Result:** ✅ Fully compliant

## 4. Child Invite Permissions

**Design Requirements:**
- Only allowed if `ChildSettings.canSendInvites = true`
- If `inviteRequiresApproval = true`, invite requires parent approval

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ Permission check implemented
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ⚠️ **TODO**: Invite approval workflow incomplete (creates direct invite instead of request)

**Result:** Partially implemented

## 5. Database Schema Issues

**Identified Issues:**
1. **Missing `User.isVerified` field**: Document references this field but it doesn't exist
2. **Account vs MyProfile separation**: Successfully refactored but documentation needs update

## Recommendations

1. **Update APA-Flow-Scenarios.md** to reflect actual implementation:
   - Remove references to `User.isVerified`
   - Document that email verification uses `verificationToken = null`
   - Clarify Account vs MyProfile separation

2. **Consider implementing**:
   - Child invite approval workflow (currently TODO)
   - Separate email verification from account approval

3. **Working correctly**:
   - Child sign-up flow
   - Parent approval system
   - Adult-to-child invites
   - Basic permission checks

## Conclusion

The implementation is largely compliant with the APA design, with the main discrepancy being the handling of email verification flags. The child protection flows are all working correctly, which is the most critical aspect of APA compliance.
