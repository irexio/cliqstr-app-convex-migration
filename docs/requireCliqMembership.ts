/**
 * üîê APA-HARDENED HELPER: requireCliqMembership
 * 
 * Purpose:
 *   - Enforces that the current user is an approved member of the specified cliq
 *   - Centralizes membership validation logic across all API routes
 *   - Throws appropriate errors for consistent handling
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   - Import and call this function at the start of any route that accesses cliq data
 *   - Will throw an error if validation fails, which should be caught and returned as 403
