# Invite Flow Fix Summary

## Changes Made (July 25, 2025)

### 1. Created Invitation Sent Confirmation Page
- **File**: `src/app/invite/sent/page.tsx`
- Shows success message after sending invite
- Different messages for child vs adult invites
- Provides navigation back to dashboard or send another invite

### 2. Updated InviteClient to Redirect After Success
- **File**: `src/components/InviteClient.tsx`
- Added redirect to `/invite/sent` page after successful invite
- Passes recipient name and invite type as URL parameters
- 1.5 second delay to show success message first

### 3. Removed ALL Next-Auth References
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/invite/parent/page.tsx` - Replaced with iron-session auth check
  - `src/app/invite/adult/page.tsx` - Replaced with iron-session auth check
- Added proper authentication checks using `/api/auth/status`
- Added sessionStorage context for sign-in redirects

### 4. Fixed Parent Invite Flow to Check Plan
- **File**: `src/app/invite/parent/page.tsx`
- Now checks if parent has a plan after accepting invite
- Redirects to `/choose-plan` if no plan exists
- Only goes to `/parents-hq` if plan is already selected

### 5. Fixed Sign-Up URL Parameters
- Changed `inviteCode` to `invite` parameter for consistency
- Updated both parent and adult invite pages

### 6. Added SessionStorage Context Handling
- **File**: `src/app/sign-in/sign-in-form.tsx`
- Handles both `parentInviteContext` and `adultInviteContext`
- Preserves invite flow through sign-in process
- Redirects back to appropriate invite page after authentication

## Critical Security Fix
Removed all traces of next-auth from the codebase as it violates the project's security requirements. All authentication now uses the approved iron-session approach.

## Flow Summary

### Adult → Child Invite Flow:
1. Adult sends invite with child's name and parent email
2. System shows "invitation sent" confirmation
3. Parent receives email and clicks link
4. Parent signs in or creates account
5. Parent accepts invite → checks for plan → redirects to choose-plan or parents-hq
6. Parent sets up child account in parents-hq

### Adult → Adult Invite Flow:
1. Adult sends invite with recipient email
2. System shows "invitation sent" confirmation
3. Recipient clicks email link
4. Signs in or creates account
5. Accepts invite → joins cliq → redirects to dashboard

## Next Steps
- Test all invite flows thoroughly
- Handle cases where existing users receive invites
- Ensure proper error handling for edge cases
