### 📁 Cleanup Instructions

WS must:

2. ✅ Implement soft upgrade modal on restricted actions (child invite, cliq create, etc.)
3. ✅ Add "Upgrade Plan" CTA:
   - In `MyCliqs` dashboard
   - In account dropdown
4. ❌ Ensure account dropdown links to correct My Profile

   - For all members: Invite flow, Invite approval, Child & Adult creation from sign-up
6. ✅ Confirm email templates (3 types):
   - Invited Adult
   - Invited Child (sent to parent)
   - Signup Attempt by Child
