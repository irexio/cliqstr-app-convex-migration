# TODO - Cliqstr Development Tasks

## Recently Completed - Parent Invite Flow Critical Fixes

### Date: 2025-08-18 (Updated)
### Developer: Claude

#### Summary
Fixed critical issues in the invited child flow and implemented duplicate child prevention to ensure a smooth parent approval process.

#### Changes Made:

1. **Added Child Last Name Support**
   - Updated `InviteClient.tsx` to collect both first and last name for child invites
   - Modified database schema to add `friendLastName` field to Invite table
   - Updated email templates to show full child name (first + last)
   - Parents can now clearly identify which child is being invited (e.g., "Johnny Smith" vs "Johnny Jones")

2. **Implemented Duplicate Child Prevention**
   - Added check in `/api/parent/children` to prevent creating duplicate children
   - Uses parent email + child first name + last name as composite key
   - Shows friendly error: "A child named [Name] already exists. Please provide a unique name for this child."
   - Prevents confusion when parents have multiple children

3. **Fixed Cookie and Redirect Issues**
   - Enhanced `/invite/[token]` route to fetch all necessary invite data
   - Improved cookie handling with proper Base64-URL encoding
   - Cookie now includes child name data for prefilling forms
   - Fixed redirect logic to properly route child invites to `/parents/hq#create-child`

4. **Improved Parent Approval Flow**
   - Parents HQ page now fetches and passes invite code (not just ID)
   - Child creation form prefills with invited child's first and last name
   - Fixed data passing between components (inviteCode, friendFirstName, friendLastName)
   - Ensured invite is properly marked as accepted after child creation

#### Technical Details:

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/InviteClient.tsx` - Added last name field to invite form
- `src/app/api/invite/create/route.ts` - Handle friendLastName in invite creation
- `src/lib/auth/sendChildInviteEmail.ts` - Show full name in emails
- `src/app/invite/[token]/route.ts` - Fetch and pass complete invite data
- `src/app/api/parent/children/route.ts` - Add duplicate prevention logic
- `src/components/parents/wizard/ChildCreateModal.tsx` - Prefill child names, use invite code
- `src/components/parents/ParentsHQWithSignup.tsx` - Pass invite data to child modal
- `src/app/parents/hq/page.tsx` - Fetch invite code and child names
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added friendLastName field

#### Testing Notes:
- Test full flow: Send child invite � Parent clicks email link � Creates account � Child added to cliq
- Verify duplicate prevention works with same parent + child name combination
- Check that child names are properly prefilled in the creation form
- Ensure invite is marked as used after successful child creation

#### Next Steps:
- Run full end-to-end testing of the invite flow
- Consider adding middleware to validate invite tokens earlier in the flow
- Potentially add support for middle names or nicknames

## Critical Bug Fixes - Parent Invite Flow

### Date: 2025-08-18 (Afternoon)
### Developer: Claude

#### Summary
Fixed critical "No pending invite" error and parent signup hanging issue that completely broke the child-to-child invite flow where parent approval is required.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Cookie Deletion Bug (Root Cause of "No pending invite")**
   - The `/invite/[token]` route was setting the `pending_invite` cookie then immediately deleting it on the next line
   - This meant when parents reached `/parents/hq`, no cookie was available
   - Same issue existed in `/api/invite/resolve-join-code` route

2. **Parent Email Not Auto-Populating**
   - The code was looking for parent email in `inviteeEmail` field
   - For child invites, parent email is actually stored in `trustedAdultContact`
   - The `trustedAdultContact` field wasn't being queried from the database

3. **Parent Signup Hanging**
   - Invite status was prematurely changed from `'pending'` to `'accepted'` during parent signup
   - After page refresh, the logic checked for `status === 'pending'` to show child creation
   - Since status was already `'accepted'`, the page didn't know what to display next

4. **Missing CliqId**
   - The `cliqId` wasn't being queried or stored in the cookie
   - This is critical for knowing which cliq the child should join

#### Fixes Applied:

1. **Fixed Cookie Persistence**
   - Removed erroneous `res.cookies.delete('pending_invite')` lines
   - Cookies now properly persist through the signup flow
   - Added proper domain handling for production vs development

2. **Fixed Email Auto-Population**
   - Added `trustedAdultContact` to invite database query
   - Updated logic to use `trustedAdultContact` for child invites
   - Parent email now correctly prefills in signup form

3. **Fixed Status Management**
   - Invite remains `'pending'` during parent signup
   - Only changes to `'accepted'` when child account is created
   - Page refresh now correctly shows child creation form

4. **Added CliqId Tracking**
   - Added `cliqId` to all invite queries
   - Included `cliqId` in cookie data
   - Ensures child joins the correct cliq

5. **Fixed Invite Expiration**
   - Changed from 30 days to 7 days as per requirements
   - Maintains 24-hour cookie expiration (sufficient for signup)

#### Technical Details:

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/invite/[token]/route.ts` - Fixed cookie deletion bug, added cliqId
- `src/app/api/invite/resolve-join-code/route.ts` - Fixed cookie deletion bug
- `src/app/parents/hq/page.tsx` - Added trustedAdultContact query, fixed email logic
- `src/app/api/wizard/parent-signup/route.ts` - Keep invite status as pending
- `src/app/api/invite/create/route.ts` - Set 7-day expiration

#### The Corrected Flow:
1. Child invites another child, provides parent email as `trustedAdultContact`
2. Parent clicks invite link → Cookie is properly set and persists
3. Parent sees signup form with email auto-populated
4. Parent creates account → Invite stays `'pending'`, session created
5. Page refreshes → Shows child creation form (invite still pending)
6. Parent creates child account → Invite becomes `'accepted'`
7. Child is added to the correct cliq

#### Testing Notes:
- Verify cookie persists after clicking invite link
- Confirm parent email auto-populates in signup form
- Test that page shows child creation after parent signup
- Ensure child joins the correct cliq
- Verify 7-day invite expiration works
