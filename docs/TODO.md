# üìã TODO.md - Current Session Plan

## üéØ Session Objectives
Based on recent commits and CLAUDE.md instructions, focusing on critical flow issues and broken functionality.

## üìä Current Status Assessment
- **Recent Work**: Accessibility improvements, UploadThing fixes, UI/UX updates for MyCliqs dashboard
- **Git Status**: 
  - Modified: CLAUDE.md
  - Deleted: public/finished-profile.png
  - New file: docs/TODO.md (this file)
- **Key Issues from CLAUDE.md**:
  - Sign-up flow verification issues
  - Invite flow validation problems
  - UploadThing integration (recently worked on but may need verification)
  - Parent approval flow integrity

## ‚úÖ Todo List

### 1. Verify Adult Sign-Up Flow ‚è≥
- [ ] Test adult sign-up modal flow
- [ ] Verify email confirmation process (Resend integration)
- [ ] Check User.isVerified flag is set correctly on email confirmation
- [ ] Ensure redirect to /choose-plan after verification
- [ ] Verify Account.isApproved is set after plan selection
- [ ] Confirm redirect to /my-cliqs-dashboard after plan selection

### 2. Verify Child Sign-Up Flow ‚è≥
- [ ] Test child sign-up detection (age < 18)
- [ ] Verify parent email prompt appears
- [ ] Check Resend email is sent to parent
- [ ] Confirm child sees /awaiting-approval page
- [ ] Test parent approval link functionality
- [ ] Verify ParentLink creation on approval
- [ ] Ensure parent can set child credentials in /parents-hq

### 3. Fix Invite Validation Issues ‚è≥
- [ ] Debug /api/validate-invite route
- [ ] Fix hanging invite link validation
- [ ] Test adult-to-adult invite flow
- [ ] Test adult-to-child invite flow (with parent approval)
- [ ] Verify child invite permissions (ChildSettings.canSendInvites)
- [ ] Test invite approval flow when inviteRequiresApproval = true

### 4. Verify UploadThing Integration ‚è≥
- [ ] Check current UploadThing configuration
- [ ] Test file upload functionality
- [ ] Verify error handling (recent commits suggest fixes were made)
- [ ] Ensure profile images and cliq images upload correctly

### 5. Validate Parent Approval Flow ‚è≥
- [ ] Test /parent-approval route with query parameters
- [ ] Verify parent account creation if needed
- [ ] Check automatic test plan application
- [ ] Ensure proper redirect to /parents-hq
- [ ] Verify child credential setup requirement

### 6. Security & Compliance Checks ‚è≥
- [ ] Verify session-based auth is working (no token auth)
- [ ] Check role-based access (adult vs child)
- [ ] Ensure children cannot self-approve
- [ ] Verify Red Alert confirmation popup
- [ ] Check global visibility restrictions

## üö´ Critical Rules to Follow
1. **DO NOT** simplify or remove ANY friction from APA flows
2. **DO NOT** allow children to bypass parent approval
3. **DO NOT** use token-based authentication
4. **DO NOT** expose users outside of shared cliqs
5. **DO NOT** modify Red Alert system without approval

## üìù Implementation Notes
- All changes must be minimal and focused
- Test each flow completely before moving to next
- Update this document as tasks are completed
- Add review section at end of session

## üìö Review Section

### UploadThing Integration Fixes (July 25, 2025)

**Issue**: Image uploads were not working correctly - blob URLs were being used instead of UploadThing URLs

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Profile Creation** (`src/components/CreateProfileForm.tsx`)
   - Updated onClientUploadComplete to handle both `url` and `fileUrl` properties
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Fixed response handling to properly extract file URLs

2. **Profile Edit** (`src/components/NewProfileClient.tsx`)
   - Fixed handleSave to actually call the `/api/profile/update` endpoint
   - Updated upload handlers for both avatar and banner
   - Added proper error handling

3. **Cliq Creation** (`src/app/cliqs/build/build-cliq-client.tsx`)
   - Updated banner upload handler to properly extract URLs
   - Added console logging for debugging

4. **Scrapbook Gallery** (`src/components/ScrapbookGallery.tsx`)
   - Fixed image upload handler to work with UploadThing response format

**Key Changes**:
- All upload handlers now check for both `res[0].url` and `res[0].fileUrl` 
- Added extensive console logging to help debug upload issues
- Fixed the profile edit save functionality that was missing API call

**Session Started**: July 25, 2025
**Status**: Completed

### Session Security Implementation (July 25, 2025)

**Tasks Completed**:

1. **Part 1: Session Cookie Vulnerability Fix** ‚úÖ
   - **Installed iron-session** for encrypted session management
   - **Created session configuration** at `/src/lib/auth/session-config.ts` with:
     - 32+ character SESSION_SECRET from environment
     - 30-minute session timeout
     - Secure cookie settings (httpOnly, secure, sameSite=lax)
   - **Updated all session writes**:
     - `/src/app/api/sign-in/route.ts` - Now uses encrypted sessions
     - `/src/app/api/parent-approval/complete/route.ts` - Now uses encrypted sessions  
     - `/src/app/api/sign-out/route.ts` - Properly destroys encrypted sessions
   - **Rewrote getCurrentUser** to:
     - Read encrypted sessions instead of raw user IDs
     - Implement 30-minute inactivity timeout
     - Use dynamic imports to avoid server/client boundary issues
   - **Added SESSION_SECRET** to `.env.local`

   **Security Improvements**:
   - Sessions are now encrypted and signed - cannot be tampered with
   - No more raw user IDs exposed in cookies
   - Automatic session expiration after 30 minutes of inactivity
   - All session cookies maintain httpOnly, secure, and sameSite=lax flags

2. **Part 2: Child Permission Check** ‚úÖ
   - **Implemented `canCreatePublicCliqs` permission check** in `/src/app/api/cliqs/create/route.ts`
   - Added validation after input parsing (line 73-84)
   - Checks if user role is 'Child' and privacy is 'public'
   - Queries ChildSettings table for the permission
   - Returns 403 error with clear message if permission is denied
   - Logs blocked attempts for security auditing

**Key Decisions**:
- Used iron-session over alternatives for its simplicity and Next.js compatibility
- Set 30-minute timeout as specified in security plan
- Used dynamic imports in getCurrentUser to avoid build issues
- Maintained all existing security flags on cookies
- Placed child permission check after input validation for efficiency

**Security Improvements Summary**:
- ‚úÖ No more raw user IDs in cookies (impersonation attack prevented)
- ‚úÖ Encrypted, tamper-proof sessions with 30-minute timeout
- ‚úÖ Children cannot create public cliqs without parent permission
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages and audit logging for blocked attempts

**Session Started**: July 25, 2025
**Status**: Completed - Both security vulnerabilities fixed

### Login Issue Fix (July 25, 2025)

**Issue**: User unable to log in after iron-session security implementation

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Cookie Name Mismatch**:
   - Session config used cookie name: `'cliqstr-session'`
   - Middleware was checking for cookie named: `'session'`
   - This caused authentication to fail as middleware couldn't find the session cookie

2. **Profile Creation Redirect Loop**:
   - Dashboard page was checking if username DOESN'T start with 'user-' to determine if user has profile
   - Profile creation page had same logic, creating infinite redirect loop
   - User with username 'mimi' was stuck between the two pages

3. **UploadThing Image Display**:
   - Images were uploading successfully but not displaying
   - File paths were showing as "Image (1MB)" instead of actual images

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Fixed Cookie Name in Middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`):
   - Changed line 15 from `req.cookies.get('session')` to `req.cookies.get('cliqstr-session')`
   - This ensures middleware can properly read the encrypted session cookie

2. **Fixed Profile Detection Logic** (`src/app/my-cliqs-dashboard/page.tsx`):
   - Updated hasProfile check to be more explicit
   - Added null check for username to prevent edge cases
   - Logic now properly identifies users with complete profiles

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Verified SESSION_SECRET in .env.local (user generated new secure key)
   - Confirmed SESSION_SECRET was added to Vercel environment variables
   - Redeployed application with new configuration

**Key Decisions**:
- Maintained iron-session security implementation
- Fixed issues without removing security features
- Kept all APA-compliant authentication flows intact

**Status**: Completed - Login functionality restored while maintaining security improvements
