# TODO - Cliqstr Development Tasks

## Recently Completed - Invited Child Flow Fixes

### Date: 2025-08-18
### Developer: Claude

#### Summary
Fixed critical issues in the invited child flow and implemented duplicate child prevention to ensure a smooth parent approval process.

#### Changes Made:

1. **Added Child Last Name Support**
   - Updated `InviteClient.tsx` to collect both first and last name for child invites
   - Modified database schema to add `friendLastName` field to Invite table
   - Updated email templates to show full child name (first + last)
   - Parents can now clearly identify which child is being invited (e.g., "Johnny Smith" vs "Johnny Jones")

2. **Implemented Duplicate Child Prevention**
   - Added check in `/api/parent/children` to prevent creating duplicate children
   - Uses parent email + child first name + last name as composite key
   - Shows friendly error: "A child named [Name] already exists. Please provide a unique name for this child."
   - Prevents confusion when parents have multiple children

3. **Fixed Cookie and Redirect Issues**
   - Enhanced `/invite/[token]` route to fetch all necessary invite data
   - Improved cookie handling with proper Base64-URL encoding
   - Cookie now includes child name data for prefilling forms
   - Fixed redirect logic to properly route child invites to `/parents/hq#create-child`

4. **Improved Parent Approval Flow**
   - Parents HQ page now fetches and passes invite code (not just ID)
   - Child creation form prefills with invited child's first and last name
   - Fixed data passing between components (inviteCode, friendFirstName, friendLastName)
   - Ensured invite is properly marked as accepted after child creation

#### Technical Details:

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/InviteClient.tsx` - Added last name field to invite form
- `src/app/api/invite/create/route.ts` - Handle friendLastName in invite creation
- `src/lib/auth/sendChildInviteEmail.ts` - Show full name in emails
- `src/app/invite/[token]/route.ts` - Fetch and pass complete invite data
- `src/app/api/parent/children/route.ts` - Add duplicate prevention logic
- `src/components/parents/wizard/ChildCreateModal.tsx` - Prefill child names, use invite code
- `src/components/parents/ParentsHQWithSignup.tsx` - Pass invite data to child modal
- `src/app/parents/hq/page.tsx` - Fetch invite code and child names
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added friendLastName field

#### Testing Notes:
- Test full flow: Send child invite ’ Parent clicks email link ’ Creates account ’ Child added to cliq
- Verify duplicate prevention works with same parent + child name combination
- Check that child names are properly prefilled in the creation form
- Ensure invite is marked as used after successful child creation

#### Next Steps:
- Run full end-to-end testing of the invite flow
- Consider adding middleware to validate invite tokens earlier in the flow
- Potentially add support for middle names or nicknames
