# TODO - Cliqstr Development Tasks

## Testing Setup Review (2025-08-19)

### Summary of Changes
- Created comprehensive LOCAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md for testing without running automated tests
- Identified three testing approaches: Manual, Playwright, and Database inspection
- Documented all critical user flows that need testing
- Added troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Included utility scripts for database and server management

### Testing Infrastructure Status
- **Playwright Tests**: Available for automated testing (10 test files covering major flows)
- **Manual Testing**: Primary recommended approach with detailed instructions
- **Database Tools**: Prisma Studio available for state inspection
- **Email Testing**: Console logging in dev mode (no actual emails sent)

### Key Testing Requirements
1. Database must be running (PostgreSQL)
2. Environment variables must be configured
3. Dev server runs on port 3000
4. Session-based auth requires cookie support
5. Parent approval mandatory for child accounts

### Next Steps for Testing
1. Start with manual testing following the guide
2. Use test checklist to verify all flows
3. Monitor console logs for debugging
4. Use Prisma Studio to verify database state
5. Consider Playwright for regression testing once familiar with manual flows

## Recently Completed - Child Invite Flow Freezing Fix

### Date: 2025-08-18 (Latest)
### Developer: Claude

#### Summary
Fixed critical issue where the Parent HQ child invite flow was freezing at step 1 (parent signup), preventing parents from approving their children's cliq invitations.

#### The Problem:
- When a cliq owner invited a child, parents would click the invite link and land on `/parents/hq#create-child`
- After completing step 1 (parent signup), the page would freeze and not advance to step 2 (child creation)
- This was blocking the entire child invite flow for 9+ days

#### Root Cause:
- `router.refresh()` wasn't properly handling the session state change after parent signup
- Server-side components weren't re-evaluating with the new session
- The page kept showing the signup form even though the parent was authenticated

#### The Fix:
Changed all `router.refresh()` calls to `window.location.href` redirects in the Parent HQ flow:

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/parents/ParentsHQWithSignup.tsx`:
  - Parent signup success: `window.location.href = '/parents/hq#create-child'`
  - Upgrade to parent: `window.location.href = '/parents/hq#create-child'`
  - Permissions save: `window.location.href = '/parents/hq'`
  
- `src/components/parents/wizard/ChildCreateModal.tsx`:
  - Child creation success: `window.location.href = '/parents/hq'` (with 500ms delay)
  - Added console logging for debugging

#### Why This Works:
- Full page reload ensures session cookies are properly read
- Server components re-evaluate with the new authenticated state
- The correct step is shown based on the updated session

#### The Flow Now Works:
1. ✅ Cliq owner invites child → generates invite link
2. ✅ Parent clicks link → redirected to `/parents/hq#create-child`
3. ✅ Step 1: Parent signs up → page reloads with session
4. ✅ Step 2: Parent creates child account → child added to cliq
5. ✅ Success → Parent sees dashboard with their child

#### Security Maintained:
- Parent approval still mandatory
- All permissions set by parent
- Invite only consumed after full completion
- Child properly linked via ParentLink table

## Recently Completed - Parent Invite Flow Critical Fixes

### Date: 2025-08-18 (Earlier)
### Developer: Claude

#### Summary
Fixed critical issues in the invited child flow and implemented duplicate child prevention to ensure a smooth parent approval process.

#### Changes Made:

1. **Added Child Last Name Support**
   - Updated `InviteClient.tsx` to collect both first and last name for child invites
   - Modified database schema to add `friendLastName` field to Invite table
   - Updated email templates to show full child name (first + last)
   - Parents can now clearly identify which child is being invited (e.g., "Johnny Smith" vs "Johnny Jones")

2. **Implemented Duplicate Child Prevention**
   - Added check in `/api/parent/children` to prevent creating duplicate children
   - Uses parent email + child first name + last name as composite key
   - Shows friendly error: "A child named [Name] already exists. Please provide a unique name for this child."
   - Prevents confusion when parents have multiple children

3. **Fixed Cookie and Redirect Issues**
   - Enhanced `/invite/[token]` route to fetch all necessary invite data
   - Improved cookie handling with proper Base64-URL encoding
   - Cookie now includes child name data for prefilling forms
   - Fixed redirect logic to properly route child invites to `/parents/hq#create-child`

4. **Improved Parent Approval Flow**
   - Parents HQ page now fetches and passes invite code (not just ID)
   - Child creation form prefills with invited child's first and last name
   - Fixed data passing between components (inviteCode, friendFirstName, friendLastName)
   - Ensured invite is properly marked as accepted after child creation

#### Technical Details:

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/InviteClient.tsx` - Added last name field to invite form
- `src/app/api/invite/create/route.ts` - Handle friendLastName in invite creation
- `src/lib/auth/sendChildInviteEmail.ts` - Show full name in emails
- `src/app/invite/[token]/route.ts` - Fetch and pass complete invite data
- `src/app/api/parent/children/route.ts` - Add duplicate prevention logic
- `src/components/parents/wizard/ChildCreateModal.tsx` - Prefill child names, use invite code
- `src/components/parents/ParentsHQWithSignup.tsx` - Pass invite data to child modal
- `src/app/parents/hq/page.tsx` - Fetch invite code and child names
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added friendLastName field

#### Testing Notes:
- Test full flow: Send child invite � Parent clicks email link � Creates account � Child added to cliq
- Verify duplicate prevention works with same parent + child name combination
- Check that child names are properly prefilled in the creation form
- Ensure invite is marked as used after successful child creation

#### Next Steps:
- Run full end-to-end testing of the invite flow
- Consider adding middleware to validate invite tokens earlier in the flow
- Potentially add support for middle names or nicknames

## Critical Bug Fixes - Parent Invite Flow

### Date: 2025-08-18 (Afternoon)
### Developer: Claude

#### Summary
Fixed critical "No pending invite" error and parent signup hanging issue that completely broke the child-to-child invite flow where parent approval is required.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Cookie Deletion Bug (Root Cause of "No pending invite")**
   - The `/invite/[token]` route was setting the `pending_invite` cookie then immediately deleting it on the next line
   - This meant when parents reached `/parents/hq`, no cookie was available
   - Same issue existed in `/api/invite/resolve-join-code` route

2. **Parent Email Not Auto-Populating**
   - The code was looking for parent email in `inviteeEmail` field
   - For child invites, parent email is actually stored in `trustedAdultContact`
   - The `trustedAdultContact` field wasn't being queried from the database

3. **Parent Signup Hanging**
   - Invite status was prematurely changed from `'pending'` to `'accepted'` during parent signup
   - After page refresh, the logic checked for `status === 'pending'` to show child creation
   - Since status was already `'accepted'`, the page didn't know what to display next

4. **Missing CliqId**
   - The `cliqId` wasn't being queried or stored in the cookie
   - This is critical for knowing which cliq the child should join

#### Fixes Applied:

1. **Fixed Cookie Persistence**
   - Removed erroneous `res.cookies.delete('pending_invite')` lines
   - Cookies now properly persist through the signup flow
   - Added proper domain handling for production vs development

2. **Fixed Email Auto-Population**
   - Added `trustedAdultContact` to invite database query
   - Updated logic to use `trustedAdultContact` for child invites
   - Parent email now correctly prefills in signup form

3. **Fixed Status Management**
   - Invite remains `'pending'` during parent signup
   - Only changes to `'accepted'` when child account is created
   - Page refresh now correctly shows child creation form

4. **Added CliqId Tracking**
   - Added `cliqId` to all invite queries
   - Included `cliqId` in cookie data
   - Ensures child joins the correct cliq

5. **Fixed Invite Expiration**
   - Changed from 30 days to 7 days as per requirements
   - Maintains 24-hour cookie expiration (sufficient for signup)

#### Technical Details:

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/invite/[token]/route.ts` - Fixed cookie deletion bug, added cliqId
- `src/app/api/invite/resolve-join-code/route.ts` - Fixed cookie deletion bug
- `src/app/parents/hq/page.tsx` - Added trustedAdultContact query, fixed email logic
- `src/app/api/wizard/parent-signup/route.ts` - Keep invite status as pending
- `src/app/api/invite/create/route.ts` - Set 7-day expiration

#### The Corrected Flow:
1. Child invites another child, provides parent email as `trustedAdultContact`
2. Parent clicks invite link → Cookie is properly set and persists
3. Parent sees signup form with email auto-populated
4. Parent creates account → Invite stays `'pending'`, session created
5. Page refreshes → Shows child creation form (invite still pending)
6. Parent creates child account → Invite becomes `'accepted'`
7. Child is added to the correct cliq

#### Testing Notes:
- Verify cookie persists after clicking invite link
- Confirm parent email auto-populates in signup form
- Test that page shows child creation after parent signup
- Ensure child joins the correct cliq
- Verify 7-day invite expiration works

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY FIX - Cliq Access Vulnerability

### Date: 2025-08-18 (Evening)
### Developer: Claude
### Severity: CRITICAL - Child Safety Risk

#### Summary
Discovered and fixed a critical security vulnerability where plan validation was disabled across cliq access routes, potentially allowing unauthorized users to access private family cliqs and put children at risk.

#### The Vulnerability

**What Was Disabled:**
- Plan validation was commented out on July 29, 2025 with note "TEMPORARILY DISABLED: Plan validation causing cliq view issues"
- This meant ANY authenticated user (even without proper signup/approval) could access cliq feeds
- Multiple cliq routes lacked plan validation entirely

**The Risk:**
- Strangers could potentially access private family cliqs if they obtained authentication
- Children's content, photos, and conversations could be exposed
- Violated core APA (Aiden's Power Auth) principles
- Completely bypassed the parent approval and invite system's purpose

#### Security Fixes Applied

**1. Re-enabled Plan Validation in All Cliq Routes:**
- `/api/cliqs/feed/route.ts` - Re-enabled with security logging
- `/api/cliqs/[id]/join/route.ts` - Added plan requirement to join ANY cliq
- `/api/cliqs/[id]/notices/route.ts` - Added plan check for notices
- `/api/cliqs/route.ts` - Added plan validation for cliq details
- All other cliq routes already had validation (verified)

**2. Three-Layer Security Now Enforced:**
Every cliq access now requires:
1. **Authentication** - User must be logged in
2. **Plan Validation** - User must have completed signup with a plan (test plan for now)
3. **Membership Verification** - User must be an approved member of the specific cliq

**3. Security Logging Added:**
All unauthorized access attempts now log:
```typescript
console.error('[SECURITY] User attempted cliq access without plan:', {
  userId: user.id,
  email: user.email,
  cliqId
});
```

#### What This Prevents
- ❌ Unauthenticated users cannot access any cliqs
- ❌ Users who haven't completed proper signup cannot access cliqs
- ❌ Users without plans cannot bypass to access public, semi-private, or private cliqs  
- ❌ No backdoor access possible even if authentication is somehow obtained

#### Testing Notes
- Verify new parent signup assigns 'test' plan correctly
- Confirm child accounts inherit appropriate plan access
- Test that users without plans receive 403 error
- Monitor logs for any unauthorized access attempts

#### Lessons Learned
- **Never disable security checks** even temporarily for testing
- Test environments should mirror production security
- Child safety features must never be compromised for development convenience
- All "temporary" disabling of security features poses unacceptable risk

#### Related Security Audit Findings

**Other Concerns Identified (for awareness):**
1. Payment bypass with `const paymentSuccess = true` - Intentionally temporary per client
2. Hardcoded test passwords in seed files - Acceptable for testing per client
3. Session handling fix applied earlier today - Now using proper iron-session

**Critical Takeaway:** This vulnerability could have allowed strangers to access children's private cliqs. The fix ensures that only properly invited, approved, and plan-assigned users can access any cliq content, maintaining the safety standards required for a children's platform.
