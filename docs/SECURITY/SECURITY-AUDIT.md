## üß™ RECOMMENDED FUTURE AUDIT ENHANCEMENTS

* Add `/api/debug/invite-status` to check code state
* Add signed audit hash or `eventId` for each `ParentAuditLog` action
* Expose child audit log to parent inside `/parents/hq`
* Create optional verification screen after `/parent-approval/complete` to visually confirm that:

  * All permissions were stored
  * Invite context was linked
  * Child was approved

---

## üìå FINAL COMPLIANCE NOTES

As of this update, the APA system:

* Blocks all children from accessing Cliqs until parent-approved
* Prevents `invite.used = true` until full setup
* Issues session cookies only after compliance is verified
* Creates traceable `ParentLink`, `ChildSettings`, and `AuditLog` records
* Allows re-approval attempts without corrupting database state

‚úÖ CLIQSTR‚ÄôS APA FLOW IS NOW **VERIFIABLE, AUDITABLE, AND ENFORCED**
