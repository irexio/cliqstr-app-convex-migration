# üõ°Ô∏è Cliqstr - Private Social Platform for Families

> **Protecting children online through privacy, parental controls, and purposeful design.**

## What is Cliqstr?

Cliqstr is an **invite-only, ad-free social platform** designed specifically for families who prioritize safety and privacy. Unlike traditional social media, Cliqstr puts parents in control while giving children age-appropriate freedom to connect with family and friends.

### üéØ Our Mission

Create a digital space where:
- Children can safely explore social connections
- Parents have peace of mind without being overbearing  
- Families stay connected across generations
- Privacy is guaranteed, not promised

## üö∏ Key Safety Features

## üîê Technical Security

### Custom Authentication (APA)
We built our own authentication system because standard solutions (Clerk, Auth0, Supabase) cannot handle:
- Parent-child relationships
- Approval workflows
- Real-time monitoring
- Session-based permissions
- Role-based access control

## üíª Tech Stack

### Current Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Neon (serverless)
- **ORM**: Prisma with type-safe queries
- **Authentication**: Custom APA with iron-session
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui components
- **File Uploads**: UploadThing (secure, COPPA-compliant)
- **Payments**: Stripe (subscription management)
- **Email**: Resend (transactional emails)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (edge functions)

### Coming Soon (In Development)
- **Mobile Apps**: TWA (Trusted Web Activity) + Capacitor
- **AI Moderation**: Content safety for public cliqs
