# üîí Cliqstr Security Review - Child Safety Focus

## Executive Summary
Cliqstr has strong foundational security with session-based auth and parental controls. However, several critical gaps need addressing to ensure complete child safety.

## ‚úÖ Current Security Strengths

### 1. Authentication & Session Management
- **Session-only auth** - No JWT tokens exposed to client
- **30-minute timeout** - Auto-logout on inactivity
- **CSRF protection** - Built into session cookies
- **Password hashing** - Using bcrypt

### 2. Age-Based Access Control
- Automatic child detection from birthdate
- Parent email required for child sign-ups
- Children blocked from public cliqs
- Role-based permissions (Child/Adult/Parent)

### 3. Privacy by Design
- **Profile isolation** - Can only view profiles of cliq members
- **No global user directory** - No way to browse all users
- **Invite-only system** - No open registration to cliqs
- **Parent approval flow** - Children cannot self-approve

## üö® Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Missing Child Restrictions in Cliq Creation
**Location**: `/src/app/api/cliqs/create/route.ts`
**Issue**: Children can create public cliqs without restriction
**Fix Required**:
```typescript
// Add after line 56
if (user.role === 'Child' && privacy === 'public') {
  const childSettings = await prisma.childSettings.findUnique({
    where: { profileId: user.profile.id }
  });
  
  if (!childSettings?.canCreatePublicCliqs) {
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      error: 'You need parent permission to create public cliqs' 
    }, { status: 403 });
  }
}
```

### 2. Incomplete ChildSettings Enforcement
**Issues**:
- `inviteRequiresApproval` checked but not enforced
- `canPostImages` not checked during uploads
- `canAccessGames` and `canShareYouTube` not implemented

**Fix Required**: Create middleware for child permissions

### 3. Missing Rate Limiting
**Critical Endpoints**:
- `/api/sign-up` - Prevent spam accounts
- `/api/invite/create` - Prevent invite spam
- `/api/auth/sign-in` - Prevent brute force

**Recommended**: Implement rate limiting using Redis or in-memory store

### 4. No Content Moderation
**Issue**: `aiModerationLevel` field exists but unused
**Risk**: Inappropriate content exposure to children

## üìã Security Enhancement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)
1. [ ] Add child restrictions to cliq creation
2. [ ] Implement invite approval queue for children
3. [ ] Add rate limiting to auth endpoints
4. [ ] Block image uploads if `canPostImages=false`

### Phase 2: Content Safety (Next Sprint)
1. [ ] Integrate AI moderation API (OpenAI or Perspective)
2. [ ] Add word filter for usernames/cliq names
3. [ ] Implement content reporting system
4. [ ] Add parent notification system

### Phase 3: Advanced Protection (Future)
1. [ ] Add suspicious activity detection
2. [ ] Implement account recovery with parent verification
3. [ ] Add audit logs for all child actions
4. [ ] Create parent dashboard analytics

## üîÑ Reducing Friction Without Compromising Safety

### Current Friction Points:
1. **Email verification for adults** - Necessary but adds step
2. **Parent approval wait time** - Essential for safety
3. **Profile creation required** - Could be streamlined

### Recommended Improvements:
1. **Magic link sign-in** for returning users (adult only)
2. **Progressive onboarding** - Let users explore before full profile
3. **Simplified invite flow** - Pre-fill child's name from parent's entry
4. **Quick actions** - Allow viewing public cliq info before join

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. Implement Security Headers
```typescript
// Add to middleware.ts
const securityHeaders = {
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https://utfs.io"
}
```

### 2. Add Input Sanitization
- Sanitize all user inputs before storage
- Strip HTML/scripts from text fields
- Validate URLs for uploads

### 3. Implement Audit Logging
- Log all permission changes
- Track invite creation/acceptance
- Monitor failed auth attempts

### 4. Parent Notification System
- Email alerts for child activities
- Weekly summaries of child's usage
- Instant alerts for blocked actions

## üéØ Priority Action Items

1. **TODAY**: Fix child public cliq creation
2. **THIS WEEK**: Implement rate limiting
3. **NEXT WEEK**: Add content moderation
4. **THIS MONTH**: Complete audit system

## üìä Risk Assessment

| Risk | Current Status | Priority | Mitigation |
|------|---------------|----------|------------|
| Child accessing inappropriate content | Partially Protected | HIGH | Implement AI moderation |
| Stranger contact with children | Well Protected | LOW | Profile isolation working |
| Account takeover | Protected | MEDIUM | Add 2FA for parents |
| Data breach | Protected | LOW | Strong session management |
| Invite spam | Vulnerable | HIGH | Add rate limiting |

## ‚úÖ Compliance Checklist

- [x] COPPA age verification (13+)
- [x] Parental consent for under 18
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] Right to deletion
- [ ] Privacy policy alignment
- [ ] Terms of service updates

## üîê Security Testing Recommendations

1. **Penetration Testing**: Focus on auth bypass attempts
2. **Child Flow Testing**: Attempt to bypass parent approval
3. **Rate Limit Testing**: Stress test invite system
4. **Content Testing**: Try uploading inappropriate content

## üîÑ Convex Migration Security Notes

- ‚úÖ All child safety features preserved during migration
- ‚úÖ Parental controls remain intact
- ‚úÖ Session management unchanged
- ‚úÖ Age gating still enforced
- ‚úÖ Invite approval flow maintained

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember**: Child safety is paramount. When in doubt, choose the more restrictive option.
