# PR Checklist

- [ ] I followed the rules in `DEV_RULES.md`.

- [ ] I confirmed the route/page/component I touched does not already exist in the repo.
- [ ] If I believed it was missing, I included search output (file path & line).
- [ ] I proved persistence by running the relevant Convex function in Dashboard and included a screenshot of the Data tab.
- [ ] I completed the flow QA checklist for the flow this PR touches.
